# Project Name:  The *Issue Tracker* Application
  
# Introduction
  This simple project is to build a web application in pure JavaScript.
  It is an **Issue Tracker** application which contains only *HTML, **Bootstrap** CSS, JavaScript codes*.
  We do not need install any framworks and dependencies. I use the project to learn about **Git, Github, and
  Mardown Syntax**.

# Configuration:	
	The project does not have any setup or configuration because of its pure JavaScript application.
  The project has only two files:
1. index.html - included Bootstrap CSS to build the user interface.  It consists of two parts. The first is a
        form with three text fields, Description, Severity, Assigned To, and an "Add" button. The second is the show of 
        list of issues. 
2. Main.js - Logic to add an issue to the list and show the status of issues list.  I use localStorage to save
        for data.

# Motivation
  I use the project to learn about plain JavaScrip, Git's basic commands, **Github**, and Markdown syntax.
