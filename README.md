# Introduction
  This simple project is to build a web application in pure JavaScript.
  It is **Issue Tracker** application which contains only *HTML, **Bootstrap** CSS, JavaScript codes*.
  We do not need install any framworks and dependencies. I use the project to learn about **Git, Github, and
  Mardown Syntax**.
